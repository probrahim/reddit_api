You both need to work on your communication skills. There is no reason for him not to call when at someones house before they go to bed to let you know where they are at and whats going on, especially when you have children together. You also need to grow up. "Bruhhh" "But whateves" "are you mad? no" quit being passive aggressive, dismissive, and talk like an adult ffs.
How the fuck are you both married with children when you are both clearly no older than 13?
Could also be a drug thing tbh. But either way, it’s not normal that a married man with children is regularly having sleepovers at his single bro’s place
I feel like the fact that you keep calling your husband “bruhhh” is a good look into the maturity and quality of the relationship. 

But that aside, no, you’re NOR, he’s cheating on you and playing that game where they try to be extra nice afterwards to both make themselves feel better and try to make you turn a blind eye.
Why are you calling your husband bruhhh? While him staying at his boys is weird, if your husband hasn’t done anything to make you suspicious, don’t be suspicious.
